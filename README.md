This repo contains the code used to produce the results in the paper "Comparison of direct cDNA and PCR-cDNA Nanopore sequencing of E. coli isolates" - Rodger/Lipworth et al 2024.

Unfortunately some of the files are rather large and cannot therefore be uploaded to github. I would recommend you clone the repo locally and then download the data from our figshare repo (link to follow)
